# Hello, world!

On this blog I'll be sharing some things I've learned in my short career as a professional Software Developer.

First some biographical information. I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. I graduated from California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science.  I started my career at Amazon Lab126 in Sunnyvale, CA where I worked on test automation for various Fire OS devices for the HTML5 Platform team. This gig was short-lived as I landed a role as a Software Engineer, Tools & Infrastructure (SETI) at Google in May 2015 working with developers on Google Express. I've taken a focus on large-scale Integration Test infrastructure and work on tools to help developers debug their tests and understand their systems in production.

There are many technical challenges to solve day-to-day. However, I find shaping engineering culture to be one of the most challenging and rewarding ways of improving our product. I hope to continue that effort to improve engineering culture outside of the workplace via this blog. I hope you learn something new.
